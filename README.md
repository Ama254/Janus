# 🕶️ Shadow Forge – Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) PoC Implant Demo

Shadow Forge is a **proof-of-concept (PoC) implant framework** designed to simulate the workflow of an **APT-style operation** in a controlled and educational setting.  
This project focuses on **understanding offensive tradecraft** and building **better defensive strategies**, while avoiding any malicious payloads.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Shadow Forge is for **research and defensive training only**.  
It does not include weaponized functionality. Use only in **isolated lab environments**.

## 🌌 Concept

APT groups employ stealth, persistence, modular implants, and advanced evasion techniques to maintain long-term access in target environments.  
Shadow Forge demonstrates this concept by simulating the **life cycle of an implant**, extended with **next-generational functionalities**.

## 🧩 Threat Profile (Simulated)

**Name:** Shadow Forge (PoC Demonstrator)  
**Type:** Modular APT-style Implant Simulation  
**Motivation:** Educational / Research Use Only  
**Scope:** Demonstrates the structure, tradecraft, and operational flow of modern APT implants in a safe, controlled format.  

### 🎯 Targeting (Simulated)
- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/MacOS) — PoC only.  
- Simulates common enterprise targeting (system info, file discovery).  
- No exploitation or real intrusion capabilities included.  

### 🛠 Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs)
Shadow Forge simulates a wide range of APT behaviors:
- **Stealth Deployment** (Stage 1 → Stage 3 modular loading).  
- **Persistence Mechanisms** (registry, tasks, services – stubbed).  
- **C2 Channels** with multi-protocol fallback (HTTP, DNS, API stubs).  
- **Fileless / Memory-Only Execution** simulation.  
- **Living-off-the-Land (LOTL)** techniques using benign commands.  
- **Evasion & Anti-Analysis** stubs (sandbox/VM detection).  

### 🧠 Operational Objectives
- Maintain long-term simulated presence.  
- Provide safe “beaconing” and “task execution” flows.  
- Enable defenders to practice **detection, hunting, and response** against APT-style tactics.

## ✨ Features (PoC Simulation)

- **Modular Architecture** – Initialization, persistence, C2, tasking, evasion.  
- **Persistence Models (Simulated)** – Registry run keys, scheduled tasks, services.  
- **C2 Workflow (Stub)** – Beaconing, command receipt, encrypted channel simulation.  
- **Task Execution (Benign)** – File listing, system info, harmless commands.  
- **Logging & Telemetry** – Debug vs stealth logging modes.  
- **Next-Gen Capabilities** – Fileless execution, plug-in modules, encrypted configs, multi-stage loaders.

## 🚀 Next-Generational Functionalities

1. **Fileless & In-Memory Execution (Simulated)** – Leaves no artifacts.  
2. **Multi-Protocol C2** – HTTP(S), WebSocket, DNS tunneling, API stubs.  
3. **Advanced Evasion** – Sandbox detection, beacon jitter, environment checks.  
4. **Modular Plug-ins** – Expandable PoC implant architecture.  
5. **Self-Healing Persistence** – Watchdog and redundancy stubs.  
6. **Multi-Stage Deployment** – Loader → Core → Modules.  
7. **Living off the Land (LOTL)** – Uses built-in binaries for benign tasks.  
8. **Encrypted Config & Comms** – AES-like simulation for configs/commands.
